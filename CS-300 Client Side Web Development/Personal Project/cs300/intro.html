		<h1>&quot;About Me&quot;  </h1>
		<p> 
			My educational background was always something in computing. 
			In high school, I learned <b>HTML, CSS, and touched upon JavaScript 
			and Ruby on Rails</b>. I am certified as an MTA (<q>Microsoft 
			Technology Associate</q>) and in Adobe Photo CS6. 
			<br/> Currently, in college, I learned how to use <b>Java</b> for object-oriented 
			programming and how data structures are implemented. In addition, 
			I learned the many aspects of <b> Operating Systems </b>. My future 
			goals are to learn <b>C++</b> and to advance my skills in <b>Java</b>. 
			I chose this course because I want to learn and develop in my 
			web designing skills.
		</p>
		<p>
			In addition to speaking English, I also speak in Russian. 
			My favorite things to do are either to code or to read books. 
			My favorite trilogy is the Divergent Series by Veronica Roth. 
			I have many books that I want to read in the future; for instance, 
			the Mortal Instruments series, the Harry Potter series, and 
			the 7 Habits of Highly Successful People.
