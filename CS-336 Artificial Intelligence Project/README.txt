This program is to find the shortest path using four different heuristics. 
Make sure all six classes are in one folder. 
The classes should be within the BMS folder, under the py folder. 
The only library needed is the heapq. The Graph class was taken from Homework four.

Click execute. 

When the program executes, the console should ask for five options (the four heuristics and all the heuristics). 
Select one. Only enter 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Other input will not be accepted and the program will loop

Then the program will ask you to enter a city listed above. 
Make sure the spelling is exactly the same, including the first letter being capitalized. 
The program will loop again if the input isn’t exact.  

Once the city has been entered, the program should give you the shortest path for that specific heuristic value or all the heuristic value. 
If there is no path, the program will out “no path found”. 

The program should ask you if you want to search for another city or heuristic value. 
The only accepted values to loop through the whole program again, are “Yes”, “yes”, “y”, or “YES”.
Any other inputs will end the program.
